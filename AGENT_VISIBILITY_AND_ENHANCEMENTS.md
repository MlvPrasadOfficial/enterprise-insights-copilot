# Implementation Summary: Agent Visibility and Enhanced Output Agents

## Fixed Issues

1. **Agent Visibility After CSV Upload**
   - Fixed critical issue where agents were not visible in Live Agent Flow after CSV upload
   - Implemented robust rendering logic that ensures agent panels always appear when fileUploaded is true
   - Added debug logging to help identify and resolve agent visibility issues
   - Created hardcoded fallbacks for agent panels when enhancedAgents is missing expected agents

2. **Agent Type Consistency**
   - Updated AGENTS array to include explicit 'type' property matching the 'id' field
   - Modified agent initialization to correctly set type field from agents definition
   - Improved type checking throughout agent handling code
