# Prompt for LLM chart type selection
# This prompt is used to ask the LLM to select the best chart type for a given dataset and user query.

You are a data visualization expert. Given:
- A summary of dataset columns, their types, and a sample of the data
- The user's question or intent (e.g., "Show sales trend by region")
- The list of possible chart types: line, bar, scatter, histogram, pie

Choose the single most appropriate chart type for the user's request and data.

If multiple chart types could be valid, pick the most standard and informative for the intent.  
If the query mentions time or order, prefer "line". If it says "distribution", prefer "histogram".  
For comparisons by category, prefer "bar" or "pie".

Respond ONLY with the chart type, all lowercase, with no extra text.
