# Expandable Agent Dropdown Enhancement

## Overview
We've updated the Agent interface to provide expandable dropdown sections for both outputs and capabilities directly within the agent panels, rather than using popup-style dropdowns. This creates a more integrated and user-friendly experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Updates
- **NarrativeAgentPanel**: Added expandable output and capabilities sections
- **ReportAgentPanel**: Added expandable output and capabilities sections
- Added toggle functionality to show/hide each section independently

### 2. UI Design Improvements
- Implemented in-place expandable sections that display beneath the agent header
- Created visually distinct sections for outputs vs capabilities
- Used consistent color schemes to differentiate between the different types of content
- Enhanced the information architecture with better visual hierarchy

### 3. Animation Enhancements
- Added smooth slide-down/slide-up animations for expanding sections
- Added CSS animations in globals.css:
  - slideDown: For expanding sections
  - slideUp: For collapsing sections
  - fadeIn: For smoother transitions

### 4. Content Organization
- **Outputs Section**: 
  - Shows detailed information about what each agent produces
  - Includes formatted content samples and explanations
  - Uses color-coded sections to organize different output types

- **Capabilities Section**:
  - Lists all agent capabilities with detailed descriptions
  - Shows enabled/disabled state for each capability
  - Provides a comprehensive view of what each agent can do

## User Experience Benefits
- More intuitive interface with less cognitive load (no floating elements)
- In-context information display provides better understanding of agent functions
- Clearer visual distinction between different types of information
- Smoother transitions between states enhance the premium feel of the application
- Consistent design language across all agent types

## Technical Implementation
- Used React state to control expandable sections
- Added CSS transitions and animations for fluid user experience
- Structured the expandable sections with proper semantic HTML
- Used icons to enhance the visual understanding of each section
