- **Clean Spacing**: Optimized node positioning with consistent gaps and alignment

### 🏗️ Architectural Layers (Top to Bottom)
```
Row 1: Frontend UI (4 components)
├── File Upload, Query Input, Process Monitor, Results Display

Row 2: Backend API (4 components)  
├── API Gateway, Authentication, Agent Orchestrator, Query Parser

Row 3: Data Storage (3 components)
├── File Storage, Data Tables, Vector Store

Row 4-5: AI Agents (9 components)
├── Core: Planning, Insight, SQL, Chart, Report
├── Specialized: Data Cleaner, QA, Retrieval, Analysis

Row 6: LLM Services (1 component)
├── OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama Integration

Row 7: Output & Deploy (3 components)
├── Results Engine, Status Monitor, Cloud Deploy
```

❌ No clear visual hierarchy
```

### After (Refined Layout)
```
✅ Compact 800px organized layout
✅ Clean row-based component arrangement
✅ 24 essential components for clarity
✅ Clear architectural layers
✅ Logical top-to-bottom data flow
✅ Improved visual hierarchy with labels
```
