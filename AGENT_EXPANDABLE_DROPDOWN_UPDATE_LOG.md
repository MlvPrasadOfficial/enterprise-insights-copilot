## Changes Made

### 1. New Components

- Updated component interfaces to support all agent types

### 2. Updated LiveFlow Component

### 3. UI Enhancements

- Added animated transitions for expanding/collapsing sections
- Improved information density and readability

### 4. Documentation
- Created `EXPANDABLE_DROPDOWNS_FOR_ALL_AGENTS.md` explaining the enhancements
- Created `AGENT_DROPDOWN_UI_REFERENCE.md` with visual reference for the new UI pattern

## Results
All 12 agent types in the Live Agent Flow panel now have:
- In-place expandable sections for outputs (replacing popup dropdowns)
- In-place expandable sections for capabilities (replacing popup dropdowns)
- Expanded panel view with processing steps and progress indicators
- Consistent styling and behavior

## Before/After Comparison
### Before:
- Narrative and Report agents had expandable sections

- Limited information visibility for regular agents

### After:
- All 12 agent types use expandable sections with animations
- Consistent UX pattern across all agents
- Improved visibility of agent capabilities and outputs
- Enhanced visual hierarchy and information organization

## Technical Notes
- Used React state hooks for managing dropdown visibility
- Applied CSS animations from globals.css for smooth transitions
- Each agent gets custom styling based on its type
- All components are responsive and accessible

## Verification
Tested expandable dropdowns on all agent types:
- File Upload Agents: Data, Cleaner
- Chat Response Agents: Planner, Query, Retrieval, SQL, Insight, Chart, Critique, Debate
- Output Agents: Narrative, Report
