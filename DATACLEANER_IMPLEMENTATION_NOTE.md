# DataCleanerAgent Implementation Note

## Issue Fixed
- The DataCleanerAgent was previously showing placeholder or hallucinated values in the UI instead of real data cleaning results.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Enhanced Agent Status Tracking**
   - Modified `agent_status.py` to support additional data fields, allowing it to store complex data like cleaning results.
   - Added an `additional_data` parameter to the `update_agent_status` function, enabling agents to provide structured output.

2. **Real Data Cleaner Results in Backend**
   - Updated the file upload endpoint in `main.py` to:
     - Use the full result object returned by DataCleanerAgent's `_execute` method
     - Extract both the cleaned data and the detailed cleaning operations/statistics
     - Store these real cleaning results in the agent status system
     - Properly format the cleaning results to match the frontend's expected structure

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Modified the `EnhancedLiveFlow.tsx` component to prioritize real cleaning results from the backend
   - Added a fallback to sample data only when real results aren't available

## How It Works
1. When a user uploads a file, the DataCleanerAgent processes the data and generates real cleaning operations and statistics
2. These real results are stored in the agent status tracking system
3. When the frontend requests agent statuses, it receives the actual cleaning results
4. The UI components display the real cleaning operations and statistics

## Verification
To verify this fix is working:
1. Upload a CSV file with some data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formats, etc.)
2. The DataCleanerAgent will process the file and generate real cleaning results
3. Check the UI to confirm it's displaying actual cleaning operations performed on your data

## Note
If you still see placeholder data, make sure:
1. You've cleared your browser cache or hard-refreshed the page
2. The backend is running with the updated code
3. You're uploading a file that actually requires cleaning (the agent will only report operations it actually performed)
