## Advanced Features
- Modular loader abstraction (CSV, TXT, PDF, DOCX, MD, HTML, PPTX, IPYNB, etc.)
- SmartFAQSplitter for FAQ-style docs
- Runtime override of chunk size, overlap, model, embedding, and splitter type
- MultiRetrieverFAQChain for multi-retriever (knowledge base + FAQ) and streaming responses
- Async job orchestration for ingestion and upsert
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for OpenAI/Pinecone API calls
- Usage/cost tracking per user/session
- Per-user/session chat history and vector store management
- Test suite for loader and chain orchestration

## Config Options
- See `config/constants.py` for all overridable parameters
- Runtime overrides supported via API/frontend (see loader and chain docs)
