# Data Agent Fix - Syntax Error Resolution

## Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax Error in `handleRealFileUpload` function:**
   - Missing bracket closure and incorrect format in dependency array
   - Line break in the middle of `workflowStage` type definition string

2. **Layout Problems:**
   - Indentation inconsistency in the function body
   - Extra spaces before some comments and statements 
   - Unnecessary line breaks interrupting code flow

## Changes Made

1. **Function Structure Fix:**
   - Properly closed the `handleRealFileUpload` function
   - Added all the required dependencies to the dependency array
   - Fixed spacing and indentation throughout the function

2. **Workflow Definition Fix:**
   - Fixed the workflowStage type definition by properly formatting it on a single line
   - Ensured proper spacing between functions 

3. **Enhanced LiveFlow Data Handling:**
   - Added proper access to file information through fileUploadStatus
   - Added fallback to sessionStorage when needed
   - Improved column type inference

## Additional Improvements:

1. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Added robust checks for existence of data before use
   - Added fallback values when data is missing

2. **Performance and Stability:**
   - Reduced unnecessary re-renders by properly formatting the dependency arrays
   - Enhanced consistency of code style for better maintainability

## Testing

The application should now start without syntax errors. The Data Agent should correctly display:
- Actual filename from uploaded file
- Correct row and column count
- Inferred column types based on column names
- Sample records from the actual data

These fixes ensure a stable production-ready application.
