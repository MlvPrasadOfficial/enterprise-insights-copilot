# Data Cleaner Results Integration Fix

## Overview
We've restructured how the Data Cleaner results are displayed in the UI. Instead of showing the results as a separate section below the Data Cleaner agent panel, we now embed them directly inside the agent panel's "Outputs" tab for a more cohesive user experience.

## Key Changes

### 1. Enhanced AgentPanel with Custom Content Support
- Added a `customOutputContent` prop to the AgentPanel component
- Modified the outputs section to display custom content when provided
- Added automatic tab selection for the Outputs tab when custom content is available

### 2. Integrated Cleaning Results into Agent Panel
- Moved the DataCleanerResults component into the agent panel's outputs section
- Maintained the conditional logic to show real data when available
- Falls back to example data when real results are not available

### 3. Improved User Experience
- Results are now accessible through the "Outputs" tab
- Eliminated redundant UI sections
- Maintained the "REAL DATA" badge for transparency
- Results display automatically when available (tab auto-selected)

## Implementation Details

1. **AgentPanel Component**:
   - Added support for custom React nodes in the output section
   - Enhanced component to auto-select the outputs tab when custom content is available
   - Maintained existing styling and animation

2. **LiveFlow Component**:
   - Now passes DataCleanerResults as custom content to the AgentPanel
   - Removed the duplicate data cleaner results section that appeared below the agent
   - Maintained the conditional logic to use real vs. example data

3. **ForceExampleCleanerResults Component**:
   - Adjusted styling to fit within the agent panel context
   - Maintains clear labeling to distinguish example data

## Benefits

- **Cleaner UI**: No more duplicate agent information
- **Better Organization**: All agent outputs are in one consistent location
- **Improved Flow**: Logical grouping of agent capabilities and outputs
- **Simplified Navigation**: Users no longer need to scroll past the agent to see results

The placeholder issue has been effectively mitigated while also improving the overall UI organization and user experience.
