# Frontend React Component Error - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Identified
The Next.js development server was showing:
```
⨯ [Error: The default export is not a React Component in "/page"] {
  page: '/'
}
```

## Root Cause
The `app/page.tsx` file was **completely empty**, which caused Next.js to fail when trying to render the home page.

## Solution Applied
1. **Restored working React component**: Added a clean, functional React component to `page.tsx`
2. **Removed unused imports**: Cleaned up warnings for unused variables and imports
3. **Verified TypeScript compilation**: Ensured no syntax or type errors

## Current Working Component Structure
```tsx
"use client";
import UploadFixed from "../components/Upload_fixed";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-900 via-blue-900 to-slate-900 px-4 py-8">
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6 text-center">
          Enterprise Insights Copilot
        </h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-8 text-center">
          AI-Powered Business Intelligence Platform
        </p>
        
        <div className="bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-xl p-6 rounded-3xl">
          <UploadFixed />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Valid React component with proper default export
- ✅ Next.js 13+ app router compatible ("use client" directive)
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No JSX parsing errors
- ✅ Clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Essential upload functionality integrated

## Next Steps
The frontend should now load properly when you refresh the browser. The Enterprise Insights Copilot home page will display with:
- Professional branding and layout
- File upload functionality via UploadFixed component
- Responsive design with glassmorphism effects

Both the **JSX parsing error** (previous) and **React component error** (current) have been completely resolved.
