# Expandable Dropdowns for All Agents

## Overview

This document details the implementation of expandable dropdowns for all 12 agents in the Enterprise Insights Copilot UI. Previously, only the Narrative and Report agents featured in-place expandable sections for capabilities and outputs. This update brings consistent UI behavior across all agent types.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New `AgentPanel` Component

Created a reusable `AgentPanel` component that provides consistent expandable dropdown functionality for all agent types. This component:

- Accepts any agent data and renders appropriate UI based on agent type
- Supports in-place expandable dropdowns for both outputs and capabilities
- Uses smooth animations for dropdown transitions
- Shows agent status, progress, and processing steps
- Features type-specific styling and icons

### 2. Common Functionality Across All Agent Types

Each agent panel now includes:

- **Output Dropdown**: Shows agent-specific outputs in an expandable section
- **Capabilities Dropdown**: Displays agent capabilities with visual indicators
- **Panel Expansion**: Additional detailed information shown when expanding the panel
- **Processing Steps**: Shows the agent's workflow steps with status indicators
- **Progress Bar**: Visual indicator of agent's current progress (when working)

### 3. Styling and Visual Enhancements

- **Type-specific Gradients**: Each agent type has a unique color gradient background
- **Custom Icons**: Type-specific icons for better visual identification
- **Smooth Animations**: Uses CSS animations for smooth transitions
- **Consistent UI Pattern**: Maintains the same glassmorphic UI style throughout

### 4. Agent Type Differentiation

The component automatically determines styling and content based on agent type:

- **File Upload Agents**: Data, Cleaner
- **Chat Response Agents**: Planner, Query, Retrieval, SQL, Insight, Chart, Critique, Debate
- **Output Agents**: Narrative and Report (using specialized components)

## Usage

All agents in the LiveFlow component are now rendered using this unified approach. The panel system will:

1. Only render when a file has been uploaded
2. Display agent-specific capabilities and outputs in expandable sections
3. Show processing step status and progress information
4. Maintain consistent styling with the rest of the UI

## Benefits

- **Consistent UX**: All agents now have the same interaction pattern
- **Improved Information Density**: Expandable sections reduce visual clutter
- **Enhanced Aesthetics**: Type-specific styling and animations improve the UI
- **Better Contextual Information**: Users can quickly access agent capabilities and outputs
- **Maintainable Code**: Single component approach makes future updates easier

## Technical Implementation

The implementation uses:
- React state hooks for managing dropdown visibility
- CSS animations for smooth transitions
- Type-specific styling via dynamic class names
- Conditional rendering for each component section
- Shared animation classes in globals.css
