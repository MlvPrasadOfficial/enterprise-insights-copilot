# Data Agent Output Integration

## Introduction

This document outlines the improvements made to the Data Agent's output display in the Enterprise Insights Copilot. Previously, the Data Agent was showing hardcoded placeholder data instead of reflecting the actual uploaded file's structure and contents.

## Problem

The Data Agent component was displaying:
1. Hardcoded placeholder column types (not reflecting actual uploaded columns)
2. Hardcoded sample records instead of actual data from the uploaded file
3. Only basic file information (name and row count) was being used from the `fileUploadStatus`

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced `fileUploadStatus` Data Structure

- Updated `AgentDataState` interface to include columns list in `fileUploadStatus`
- Modified `handleRealFileUpload` to include columns in the `fileUploadStatus` object
- Added sessionStorage caching for file data to ensure persistence between page refreshes

### 2. Dynamic Data Agent Output

- Modified the `getAgentSampleOutput` function to use actual file data:
  - File name from `fileUploadStatus.fileName`
  - Row count from `fileUploadStatus.rowCount`
  - Column names from `fileUploadStatus.columns` or sessionStorage
  - Sample records from sessionStorage
  - Column types inferred from column names

### 3. Smart Column Type Detection

- Implemented basic column type inference based on column name patterns:
  - Columns with "age", "id", "amount", "count", "duration" are classified as numeric
  - Other columns are classified as categorical

## Benefits

1. **Real Data Display**: The Data Agent now shows the actual uploaded file information rather than placeholders
2. **Dynamic Column Detection**: Shows the actual number and names of columns from the uploaded file
3. **Sample Record Preview**: Displays actual data from the first rows of the uploaded file
4. **Persistent State**: Uses sessionStorage to maintain data between page refreshes

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper data type detection by sampling actual values rather than inferring from column names
2. Add more detailed statistics about data quality (missing values, data distribution)
3. Show basic visualizations of data structure directly in the Data Agent panel
