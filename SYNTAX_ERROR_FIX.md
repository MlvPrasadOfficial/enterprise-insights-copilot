# Syntax Error Fix in Page.tsx

## Issue Overview
The Enterprise Insights Copilot frontend was experiencing a syntax error in `page.tsx` around line 121, causing 500 errors when accessing the application.

## Identified Causes
1. **Main Issue**: On line 108, a comment line was directly followed by code on the same line without proper separation:
   ```tsx
   // Historical state structure    const [agentData, setAgentData] = useState<AgentDataState>({
   ```

2. **Additional Code Style Issues**: Extra trailing spaces at the end of several useState declarations that could potentially cause issues:
   ```tsx
   const [sampleData, setSampleData] = useState<any[]>([]);  
   const [columns, setColumns] = useState<string[]>([]);  
   const toastTimeout = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);  
   ```

## Applied Fixes

1. **Fixed the comment line structure**:
   ```tsx
   // Historical state structure
   const [agentData, setAgentData] = useState<AgentDataState>({
   ```

2. **Cleaned up extra trailing spaces** from lines containing useState declarations to maintain consistent code style.

## Testing Steps
1. Restart the frontend development server
2. Verify that the application loads without compilation errors
3. Test the CSV file upload functionality 
4. Confirm that agents are visible in the Live Agent Flow panel after upload

## Additional Notes
- This syntax error was likely preventing proper compilation of the frontend application
- The error prevented the agent visibility fixes from taking effect, as the application couldn't properly initialize
