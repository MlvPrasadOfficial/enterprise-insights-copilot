# UI Enhancement Update: Agent Flow Panel Reorganization

## Summary of Changes

We've implemented two key UI enhancements to improve the Enterprise Insights Copilot's user experience:

1. **Reordered Chat Response Agents** - All Chat Response Agents now appear in their exact invocation order in the UI:
   - Planning Agent
   - Query Agent
   - Retrieval Agent
   - Critique Agent
   - Debate Agent

2. **Analytics Dashboard Integration** - Created a unified Analytics Dashboard that groups related functionality:
   - Combined Insights, SQL, and Charts panels into a single tabbed component
   - Implemented intuitive tab navigation between the three related data analysis features
   - Applied consistent styling with the glassmorphic UI design language

## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Ordering

- Modified the Chat Response Agents rendering logic to use a fixed array order that matches the actual invocation sequence
- Used array mapping to ensure consistent ordering regardless of how agents appear in the data structure
- Filtered out SQL, Insight, and Chart agents from the main Chat Response Agents section

### Analytics Dashboard

- Created a new `AnalyticsPanel` component that provides tabbed access to:
  - üí° Insights (Data insights and observations)
  - üóÉÔ∏è SQL Query (Database query visualization)
  - üìä Charts (Data visualizations)
- Implemented conditional rendering based on query state and agent status
- Added responsive tab navigation with active state styling

## Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Logical grouping of related functionalities
- **More Intuitive Flow**: Chat Response Agents now visually appear in the same order they're invoked
- **Reduced UI Clutter**: Consolidation of related panels reduces cognitive load
- **Better Information Architecture**: Analytics tools are now grouped by purpose rather than agent type

## Usage Notes

The Analytics Dashboard appears after a user enters a query, just like the other Chat Response Agents.
Users can seamlessly switch between Insights, SQL, and Charts tabs without losing context or having
to scroll between different sections.
