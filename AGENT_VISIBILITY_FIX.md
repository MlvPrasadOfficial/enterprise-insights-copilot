# Agent Visibility Fix in Enterprise Insights Copilot

## Issue Overview
The Enterprise Insights Copilot UI was experiencing an issue where agents were not visible in the "Live Agent Flow" panel after CSV upload, and there was a syntax error in `page.tsx` around line 121.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Syntax Error Fix
Fixed a syntax error in `page.tsx` where two useState declarations were incorrectly placed on the same line:

```javascript
// Before (error)
const [activeFileId, setActiveFileId] = useState<string | null>(null);  const [useMultiUpload, setUseMultiUpload] = useState(false);

// After (fixed)
const [activeFileId, setActiveFileId] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [useMultiUpload, setUseMultiUpload] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Agent Visibility in Live Agent Flow

The code review confirms that the following key improvements were correctly implemented:

1. **LiveFlow Component**:
   - Properly renders all agent groups when `fileUploaded` is true
   - Uses enhanced components for Narrative and Report agents
   - Includes fallback UI when agents are not found

2. **Agent Panels**:
   - FileUploadAgentsPanel, ChatAgentsPanel, and OutputAgentsPanel all check for `fileUploaded` prop
   - Panels display even when no agents are found (using fallback UI)
   - NarrativeAgentPanel and ReportAgentPanel are properly integrated

3. **Debug and Logging**:
   - Enhanced debugging through console logs to track agent visibility
   - TroubleshootAgentFlow component available for real-time diagnosis

## Testing and Verification

After applying the syntax fix, the following behaviors should be observed:
1. Frontend should compile without syntax errors
2. After CSV upload, all agent panels should be visible in the Live Agent Flow
3. Both Narrative and Report agent panels should appear with their enhanced features
4. Even if specific agents are missing, fallback UI is displayed to maintain visual consistency

## Remaining Tasks

1. Monitor agent state during CSV upload to ensure all agents (especially narrative and report) are properly initialized with the correct type
2. Verify that the agent visibility persists throughout the application flow
3. Consider removing or disabling the troubleshooting panel once visibility is confirmed stable
